People don’t just buy products — they buy relationships. And relationships don’t begin at checkout. They begin before a prospect becomes a customer.

Too many brands rely on visibility and hope. But being seen doesn’t guarantee being chosen. The difference between a one-time buyer and a lifelong customer is deliberate nurture, a structured pathway that moves someone from a stranger to being a loyal customer. 

In this article, you’ll find details on every stage of the marketing funnel with examples on how you can use this marketing approach for your brand's marketing effort.

# What is a Marketing Funnel?

[A marketing funnel](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/marketing-funnel) is a marketing model that captures the process that a customer undergoes with a product or business. It maps out each stage of a customer's journey, from the moment they hear about a brand to the time they recommend it to their own network. 

It is a plan to deliver relevant content to potential customers based on their behavior. 

Generally made up of three main stages, a content marketing sales funnel is designed to **attract** customers, **teach** them more about your brand, **convert** them to a sale, and **retain** them. There isn't a set line between stages within your marketing funnel, but it is a way to stay organized and reach your target audience every step of the way.

# How do marketing funnels work?

Marketing funnels function as their name implies. They start broadly and become more narrow and focused at the end, forming the shape of a funnel. For example, a company may get thousands of views on its website, but only a percentage of those individuals may investigate the products further. Still, an even smaller percentage of those viewers become customers. 

Marketing funnels work by taking more direct action to steer customers through the funnel process so that they're more likely to take the company's desired action.

# Stages of the Marketing Funnel

1. ## Awareness:

[Brand awareness](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brandawareness.asp) is a marketing term for the degree to which consumers recognize a product by its name. Ideally, brand awareness means consumers recognize and view the product positively compared to competitors.

Ever wonder why you recognize, remember, and have an association with a company, even if you don’t use their products? It’s because they have strong brand awareness, which means consumers are familiar with, or aware of, their brands.

[Studies show consumers pay more attention to products they recognize, helping them remember these brands.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7303260/)

Now, let's examine what awareness looks like*.*

*XYZ Honey Company is a local artisanal honey producer that aims to expand its household consumer base. It runs a content marketing campaign focusing on the dangers of processed sugar and the unique health benefits of raw, local honey. It runs paid social media ads that target health-conscious parents and wellness enthusiasts who follow nutrition blogs. Sarah Chen is a consumer who sees a short video ad on Instagram about "The 5 Toxic Ingredients Lurking in Your Pantry." She also sees articles shared on her Facebook feed citing the company's research. She doesn't commit to making a purchase yet, but she is now aware of the XYZ Honey Company and its mission to promote healthier sweetness.*

1. ## Consideration 

[The consideration stage](https://www.salsify.com/glossary/consideration-stage-meaning) is a phase of the marketing funnel in which customers seek out research, reviews, or other information to decide whether to purchase an item.

During the consideration stage, customers need helpful information that enables them to move to the next stage of the funnel to make an informed purchasing decision. Successful brands and retailers will create detailed product descriptions and engaging content that provides the right information to customers at the right time.

Let's look back at our example from the awareness stage and see how a customer can consider a brand.

*Sarah is now actively researching natural sweeteners. She clicks through to the XYZ Honey Company's website. She reads the "Our Sweetness Switch" guide, watches a video demonstrating the sustainable, farm-fresh sourcing process, and browses customer reviews highlighting the honey's distinct floral notes and texture. She signs up for the company's recipe e-book, "10 Healthy Swaps for Sugar," which contains an introductory offer code. Sarah is now considering XYZ Honey Company and evaluating its value proposition (health, purity, mission) against generic, store-bought honey brands.*

1. ## Conversion

The goal of the conversion stage is to encourage shoppers to purchase a product or service because they believe the brand they’ve chosen is the right solution to their problem or meets their need. Also referred to as the “**decision**” or “**purchase**” phase, this step is a brand’s opportunity to invest in a strategy that will help it stand out in its category and differentiate itself from the competition.

[At the conversion stage of the funnel, things have begun to narrow significantly](https://www.fullstory.com/blog/conversion-funnels/). It’s time to convert leads into customers. Note that some conversion funnel graphics or descriptions may mark this stage as the last one.

Also sometimes called the **action** stage, the conversion stage is met when a customer makes a purchase or subscribes to your brand. It can also include other forms of conversion, like signing up for a newsletter.

The main goal is to convert leads into customers. This is typically accomplished through sales calls, sales pages, sales emails, or any combination of those three.

*Example: Sarah decides that XYZ Honey Company aligns best with her goals. She uses the introductory offer code to purchase the "Starter Sweetness Kit," which includes a jar of honey and a stainless steel dipper. She receives an order confirmation email that shares a tracking link and an immediate download link for a "Welcome to the Family" thank-you card explaining how her purchase supports the local beekeeper community. Sarah has now converted from a lead to a first-time customer.*

1. ## Retention

[Customer retention](https://mailchimp.com/resources/customer-retention-rate-explained/?gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22765388625&gbraid=0AAAABAjJLlaP6p6e9-kfX1I-5mPYyPrSu&gclid=Cj0KCQiAxJXJBhD_ARIsAH_JGjgWgq9uv4djnEU_l4xuYF2rcdckOBODSMDjSHtkMp_wElvQP1Ey7fAaAm7JEALw_wcB) describes a company’s ability to get return customers and generate repeat business.

Businesses with good customer retention capabilities have customers who return to the business again and again over time, continuing to engage with the company and make multiple purchases within a certain time period.

Businesses with poor customer retention capabilities, on the other hand, rarely see repeat business and instead lose customers after the initial sale or interaction.

Regardless of the industry you work in, you always want your customers to have a positive experience with your organization, as this can help you build relationships, improve your reputation, and generate referrals.

Maintaining a high customer retention rate is also important when it comes to profits. That’s because retaining an existing customer is typically much cheaper than acquiring a new customer.

In fact, [acquiring new customers can be five to 25 times more expensive](https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers) than retaining existing customers.

Let's look at how retaining a customer would look, from the example above.

*After Sarah receives her honey, she gets an email asking for feedback on the product and the "Sweetness Switch" guide. She is automatically enrolled in the "Sweetness Switch Insider" program, which gives her first access to seasonal honey batches and a $5 credit for referring a friend. Sarah posts a picture of her new honey jar and a recipe she made on social media, tagging the company. She then places a subscription order for a new jar every month. Sarah is now a loyal, retained customer and a brand advocate.*

There is no universally accepted version of the funnel, with varied explanations including three, four, or five or more steps consumers go through in their shopping journey.

Some people use the terms “marketing funnel” and “sales funnel” interchangeably; in fact, some combine them into one term: the marketing sales funnel. In reality, they’re two parts of a whole. Using one to inform the other can help teams stay in sync and create an optimal customer experience.
